React Concepts
6. Functional Components: Modular and reusable components for each feature and page.
7. State Management: useState for local component states and Context API for global state.
8. React Router: Provides smooth navigation across multiple pages.
9. useEffect: Handles side effects, including fetching data and triggering re-renders based on dependencies.
10. Context API and LocalStorage: Manages shared data (cart, wishlist) across components, ensuring a consistent and up-to-date view of items.
Features
11. Responsive Design: The layout adapts for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
12. Category Filter: Sidebar filter for quick access to product categories (e.g., Smartphones, Computers).
13. Shopping Cart: Add, remove, and sort items in the cart, with a maximum value limit of $1000.
14. Wishlist: Save products for later and easily transfer items to the cart.
15. Order Confirmation: Confirms purchases with a modal, displaying a congratulatory message.

Page Structure

### Home Page:

Features a banner linking to the product dashboard.
Highlights popular products in a grid layout with category filters.
Dashboard:

Displays a list of products organized by categories.
Each product card has details like name, price, and an option to view more information.


### Shopping Cart:

Displays items added to the cart with options to sort and view total cost.
Limits further purchases if the total exceeds $1000.


### Wishlist:

Allows users to save items for later and move items to the cart directly.


### Statistics Page:

Shows insights into products, such as most expensive items and price-rating correlations.

### 404 Page:

## How It Works:

### Cart and Wishlist
 1. Add to Cart: Adds products to the cart using the Context API, with immediate updates to the cartâ€™s total.
 2. Remove from Cart: Updates the total cost and state across all pages.
 3. Sorting by Price: Allows sorting cart items by descending price.
 4. Cart Limit: Prevents adding items if the total price exceeds $1000, with a notification to users.
 Wishlist
 5. Add to Wishlist: Save items for later with a single click.

6. Move to Cart: Transfer items from wishlist to cart, observing cart limitations.
7. Remove from Wishlist: Option to remove items individually.
Confirmation Modal
After purchasing, users see a modal confirming the transaction, with a redirect to the homepage and an empty cart for the next visit.

8. Future Enhancements
 Improved Filtering: Add multi-criteria filtering options.
 Product Reviews: Integrate a review system for user feedback.
 Pagination: Break down large product lists for faster load times.
 Enhanced Animations: Add subtle animations for a more engaging experience.
